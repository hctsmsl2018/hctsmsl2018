### Welcome

My name is Derek Xu, and I am a first year Computer Science major at UC Irvine who is planning to minor in Informatics. My other interests include other forms of engineering, math, and science, especially physics. As a CS major, I am currently learning discrete mathematics, intermediate Python features, and Human-Computer Interaction. Feel free to check out my projects and repositories!
